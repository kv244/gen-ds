GUI Use cases:

- when the GUI starts, the driver is not instantiated
- set file to New will attempt to open the default store
	will ask the user to choose the engine and instantiate the driver
- opening a file will set the driver to the file's engine (if compatible), or fail
	this has a slight problem as instantiating will try to open the default store if the driver isnt already instantiated 
- choosing save will save the file if the driver is instantiated
- choosing new|open while the current file is not saved will prompt the user to save
- after file is loaded, it is shown in the tree
- double clicking the tree opens the detail line in the text box; from there it can be modified (click the Update button)
- another button allows for a new row to be added (clears the text boxes, need to click Update for insert)
- about shows the existing engines supported by the driver (for now, hard return, later it should be an inspection of the classpath) --> message box
